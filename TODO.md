1. Add more models
   - LapSRN
2. Add Generative train state
3. Maybe add preprocessing steps into train_step
4. Maybe integrating training function into model is more flexible to implement?
5. Add BSRGAN's preprocessing function. But it is hard to compile it to jax.numpy.
6. Add Module Testing Codes.
